LAB-Mo-Tester
=============

Creates a toy data model and inserts sample data so you can experiment faster on the Force.com platform.

[Unmanaged package for your Existing Dev Org](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tE0000000IKOJ)

If you don't have a free Dev Org, [start by getting one here](http://developer.force.com/join).

Mo Tester is designed to make it easier for devs to try things out on the Salesforce Platform 
by providing a toy data model and light data.

Mo Tester was inspired by Steve Molis's comments on the [Button Click Admin](http://buttonclickadmin.com/) podcast. 
When asked how he tested things so quickly, he described a basic dev org pre-configured 
with an object with four of every kind of field. I smacked myself in the head and said 
we should all have one of those!
