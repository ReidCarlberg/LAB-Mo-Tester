LAB-Mo-Tester
=============

Creates a toy data model and inserts sample data so you can experiment faster on the Force.com platform.

Mo Tester is designed to make it easier for devs to try things out on the Salesforce Platform 
by providing a toy data model and light data.

Mo Tester was inspired by Steve Molis's comments on the Button Click Admin podcast. 
When asked how he tested things so quickly, he described a basic dev org pre-configured 
with an object with four of every kind of field. I smacked myself in the head and said 
we should all have one of those!

Note: @ReidCarlberg put this together, and any weaknesses aren't @SteveMoForce's fault. Thanks, Mr. Mo, for being a good sport about the name, and suggestions along the way!!

Thanks also to Matthew Botos for the stupendous SmartFactory code.
